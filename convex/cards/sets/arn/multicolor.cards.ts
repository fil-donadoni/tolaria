// Arabian Nights (ARN), split by colour per ADR 0043. The first MTG
// expansion (78 unique cards); every entry is a CardDefinition — ARN has no
// LEA reprints, so there are no CardPrint stubs (ADR 0014). Modern Scryfall
// oracle text is authoritative (ADR 0004). Generic mana is encoded as
// `X: n` (e.g. {2}{R} → { X: 2, R: 1 }). Cards are classified by the colour
// identity of their mana cost (CR 202.2); lands and artifacts (no coloured
// cost) live in colorless.ts.
//
// ARN has no multicolor cards (gold cards debuted in Legends), so this
// module is intentionally empty — kept for the consistent per-colour shape.
