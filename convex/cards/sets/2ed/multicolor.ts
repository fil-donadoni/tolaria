// 2ED (Unlimited Edition). Unlimited reprints the full Beta card list with no
// new cards, so this module is entirely CardPrint entries: each declares the
// per-edition Scryfall UUID (printId) and resolves printId -> definitionId ->
// the shared LEA/LEB CardDefinition. See ADR 0014.
//
// Excluded (mirrors LEA/LEB): ante cards (Contract from Below, Darkpact,
// Demonic Attorney) and Chaos Orb are permanently out of scope (ADR 0010).
// Camouflage shipped (#563, pile combat) and Word of Command shipped
// (#576 / #577, ADR 0037). A 2ED print lands automatically once its LEA def
// exists — see `camouflage2ed` / `wordOfCommand2ed` below.
//
// 2ED has no multicolor cards, so this module is intentionally empty —
// kept for the consistent per-colour shape (ADR 0043).
