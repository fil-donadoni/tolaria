 * Who owns a SPEC-LEVEL field when the scenario editor saves (issue #3462).

 * `updateDebugScenario` patches the row's `spec` **wholesale**, so a field the
 * editor does not re-emit is deleted from the stored scenario. Before this
 * classification the form assembled a fresh spec from its own four inputs and
 * the other six fields — `life`, `poison`, `experience`, `companion`,
 * `rngSeed`, `markLastDrawn` — silently vanished on any edit of a curated row
 * (ADR 0044 golden rows are exactly the ones carrying them).
 *
 *  - `form-owned` — the form renders an input for it, so the form's value is
 *    authoritative INCLUDING its absence (clearing `turn` must clear it).
 *  - `preserved` — the form renders nothing for it, so the loaded value is
 *    carried through untouched.
 *
 * The table is `satisfies Record<keyof ScenarioSpec, …>`: a spec field added
 * tomorrow reds `tsc` here until it is classified, which is what makes the
 * spec-widening sequence under PRD #3397 safe.
